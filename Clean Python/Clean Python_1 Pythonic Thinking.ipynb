    "* Docstrings are a powerful way to document your code in Python. Docstrings are usually written at the start of methods, classes, and modules. A docstring becomes the __doc__ special attribute of that object.\n",
    "* The Python official language recommends using \"\"\"Triple double quotes\"\"\" to write docstrings.\n",
    "* Python recommends a specific way to write docstrings. There are different ways to write docstrings, which we will discuss later in this chapter; however, all those different types follow some common rules. Python has defined the rules as follows:\n",
    "    * Triple quotes are used even if the string fits in one line. This practice is useful when you want to expand.\n",
    "    * There should not be any blank line before or after the string in triple quotes.\n",
    "    * Use a period (.) to end the statement in the docstring.\n",
    "* multiline docstring rules\n",
    "    * Writing docstrings on multiple lines is one way to document your code in a bit more descriptive way. \n",
    "    * Instead of writing comments on every line, you can write descriptive docstrings in your Python code by leveraging Python multiline docstrings. \n",
    "    * This also helps other developers to find the documentation in the code itself instead of referring to documentation that is long and tiresome to read.\n",
    "    * Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    def call_weather_api(url, location):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Get the weather of specific location.\n",

    "    :rtype: str\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "    ```\n",
    " * Structure\n",
    "     * first line is a brief description of the function/class\n",
    "     * end of the line has a period\n",
    "     * there is a one-line gap between the brief description and the summary in the docstrings\n",

    "\n",
    "### 9.1 Use List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is it\n",
    "* List comprehension is a way of writing code to solve an existing problem in a similar way as python for loop does however it allow to do that inside the list with or without if condition.\n",
    "* Main tools in python for doing this are `filter` and `map` methods\n",
    "* List comprehension is recommended -> makes your code more readable compared to other options (map/filter)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    numbers = 10, 45, 34, 89, 34, 23, 6]\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "    ### Using list comprehension\n",
    "    filtered_data = [item for item in filter if item]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* If you don’t have a complex condition or complex computation in the for loop, you should consider using list comprehension.\n",
    "    * But if you are doing many things in a loop, it’s better to stick with a loop for readability purposes\n",

    "* Using list comprehension over a `for` loop\n",
    "    * Example: identify a vowel from a list of characters\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    ```\n",

    "    * functions are more useful for traceback\n",

    "    * When you need to iterate over the list multiple times.\n",
    "    * When you need to list methods to play with data that is not available in the generator\n",

    "## 9.4 Why Not to Use else with Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python loops have an else clause . \n",

    "## 9.5 Raising Exceptions\n",
    "* Exceptions help you report errors in your code. \n",
    "* In Python, exceptions are handled by a built-in module. It’s important to have a good understanding of exceptions.\n",
    "* Exceptions can expose errors in your code without much effort, so never forget to add exceptions in your code. * Exceptions help consumers of your API or library understand the limitations of your code so they can put good error mechanisms to use while using your code\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.6 Frequently raised exceptions\n",
    "* Python prefers to have exceptions when you have a failure in your code. Even if you have a continuous failure, you want to raise an exception for it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def division(dividend, divisor):\n",
    "\"\"\"Perform arithmetic division.\"\"\"\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        return dividend/divisor\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError as zero:\n",
    "        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"Please provide greater than 0 value\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.7 Leverage finally to Handle Exceptions\n",
    "* The finally keyword is useful while handling exceptions, especially when you are dealing with resources. \n",
    "* You can use finally to make sure files or resources are closed or released, regardless of whether an exception has been raised.\n",
