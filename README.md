This repo serves as my own personal library for all things data science, programming and statistics. Wading through the deluge of articles, guides and books can be quite overwhelming so I figured a one-stop-shop of all things needed in data science would be incredibly useful. Hopefully this helps an aspiring data scientist or two!
